# üîß Final Fixes Required

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Frontend is running (http://localhost:3000)
- ‚ùå API Gateway has dependency issues
- ‚ùå Services can't find @expe/shared package

## Root Cause
Docker containers can't access the local `@expe/shared` package because it's referenced as `file:../../shared` which doesn't work in Docker context.

## Solution: Run Locally (Not Docker)

Since the services use a local shared package, it's easier to run them locally:

### Step 1: Stop Docker
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Step 2: Start Infrastructure Only
```bash
docker-compose up -d mongodb redis prometheus grafana
```

### Step 3: Run Services Locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- API Gateway on port 4000
- Auth Service on port 4001  
- Payment Service on port 4002
- Merchant Service on port 4003
- Webhook Service (background)
- Frontend on port 3000

## Alternative: Fix Docker (More Complex)

If you want to use Docker, you need to:

1. **Publish @expe/shared to npm** (private registry or public)
2. **OR** Copy shared package into each service during Docker build
3. **OR** Use Docker build context at root level

### Quick Docker Fix (Copy Shared)

Update each service Dockerfile to:
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Copy shared package
COPY ../../shared /shared
WORKDIR /shared
RUN npm install

# Copy service
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .

EXPOSE 4000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Recommended Approach

**Use Local Development:**
```bash
# Stop Docker services
docker-compose down

# Start only infrastructure
docker-compose up -d mongodb redis prometheus grafana

# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Run all services
npm run dev
```

**Access:**
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API: http://localhost:4000
- Grafana: http://localhost:3001
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090

All code is ready, just need to run locally instead of in Docker!
